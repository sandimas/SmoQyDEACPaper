# SmoQyDEAC.jl Paper Scripts
Repository of code used to generate plots for SmoQyDEAC.jl's paper [arXiv:TBD](https://arxiv.org/abs/FIXME). This is a reimplementation of the DEAC algorithm developed by Nathan S. Nichols, Paul Sokol, and Adrian Del Maestro [arXiv:2201.04155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04155).

Other software needed for these scripts:
- [`ACFlow`](https://github.com/huangli712/ACFlow): Li Huang's Analytic Continuation package
- [`SAC`](https://github.com/JefferyWangSH/sac): Jeffrey Wang's implementation of Stochastic Analytic Continuation
- [`SynthAC`]( https://github.com/sandimas/SynthAC.jl): Package to convert spectral functions to Matsubara space 

For questions and comments regarding these scripts, please email James Neuhaus at [jneuhau1@utk.edu](mailto:jneuhau1@utk.edu).
